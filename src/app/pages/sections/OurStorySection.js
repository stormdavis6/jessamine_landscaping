                        Lex Espinoza, a proud Clemson graduate, is honored to be Jessamine Landscaping’s owner-operator.
                        Lex’s original intention was to support his growing family since recently welcoming a beautiful
                        baby girl into the world.

                        Jessamine Landscaping naturally became more than that. Lex realized he can elevate those around
                        him. Blessed by God, leveraging resources around him, and being surrounded by industry veterans,
                        like his father who has proudly served the Upstate area with countless landscaping projects for
                        over a decade, Lex pulled together an experienced crew and built a strong and honest business.
